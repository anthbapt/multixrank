# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the main branch
  # aitgon: I have modified this to be triggered for all branches and not for pulls
  # aitgon: The point of CI is to be sure that a pushed software passes the tests
  # aitgon: No point to run the tests after a pull
  [push]
  #push:
  #  branches: [ main ]
  #pull_request:
  #  branches: [ main ]

    # The type of runner that the job will run on
